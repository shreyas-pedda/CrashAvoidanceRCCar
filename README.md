# CrashAvoidanceRCCar
Modified RC Car that has safety features and self-driving capabilities.

Current goals 
  1) Get the remote control to work simulteneously with the ESP32 program commands.
  2) Use PWM to reduce speed of the car when we do self-driving commands --- (limit top speed lower in general)
  3) Connect ultrasound sensors to the car and get it to stop when an obstacle is in front of it
     3.1) Figure out method to connect various ultrasound sensors to the ESP32 board
  4) Create proper body for the actual physical car, and make sure it is structurally sound and capable of withstanding collisions as that will be likely occuring often
